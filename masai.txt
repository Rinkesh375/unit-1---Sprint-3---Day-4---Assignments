Thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk about Masai and my journey in experience in Masai. I would like to let you know that in the 21st century there are many colleges and schools but Masai is different from other teaching institutes. I say this because in today's scenario if you go to any college or any school to get admission, you will have to pay first in this type of school or institute. But Masai is different because Masai claims you don't need to pay a single penny until or unless you get  5LPA and above this thing is not claimed by our colleges. As well as if you complete your course in Masai you can be a developer without having a CS degree that sounds amazing and I took admission in Masai on 16th November 2022 when I took the admission  that time I was very happy because whatever I was taught that thing I was getting and Masai teachers are amazing they are second to none to teach but nowadays I am very frustrated because we are not given enough time means that the teacher whatever they teach is very easy and they teach in a proper way we can understand those things very easily but Masai usually arranges baseless meetings like power Dressing, EC connects that waste our time. They usually arrange the meeting that is not related to your course and that is totally waste of time  that's why it is little bit frustrating because non-CS background students needs lots of time to complete assignmet due to 90% attendance required we have to join meeting  as well as a person who has designed Masai curriculum he has added some baseless things in Masai curriculum that is not going to help you in future like in unit-1, you have to learn something new and those new things are selected by Masai like you have to learn French language or you have to learn Pi or e 100 values that consumes extra time instead of this they can give us some extra questions to solve that would be great but they don't do this  that's why I am little bit angry that why they are wasting our  time if there really teach us then teach only those thing that is important for our upcoming unit apart from this everything is good in Masai  like support system is good the doubt session and the IA and Instructor are amazing so far that is different from other institute
